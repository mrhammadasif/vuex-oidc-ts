# vuex-oidc-ts

Vue.js implementation of [authts/oidc-client-ts](https://github.com/authts/oidc-client-ts), using vuex and vue-router.

## Forked from vuex-oidc

It is fork from original library, vuex-oidc with upgraded dependencies over [perarnborg/vuex-oidc](https://github.com/perarnborg/vuex-oidc) repo. Because the original library [oidc-client](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client) is archived and not in maintenance mode, I decided to fork it and publish vuex-oidc-ts, PRs and Contributions to improve it are welcome.
